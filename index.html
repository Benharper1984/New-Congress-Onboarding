  <section>
    <h2 id="tenants">Additional Guidelines for Tenants</h2>
    <h3>Month-to-Month Lease Terms</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>All tenants are on a <strong>month-to-month lease</strong>, offering flexibility for both the tenant and the household.</li>
      <li>A minimum of <strong>15 days’ notice</strong> is required from either party to end the lease, but more is encouraged.</li>
      <li>Rent is due on the <strong>first of each month</strong>, unless another arrangement has been made.</li>
      <li>Lease terms and rent amount can be renegotiated monthly with mutual agreement.</li>
      <li>Any proposed changes (e.g. rent increase, policy adjustments) will be communicated at least one month in advance.</li>
      <li>Failure to meet lease terms or uphold community agreements may result in a warning or a request to vacate, with a minimum of one week’s notice depending on circumstances.</li>
      <li>Submit rent on time (amount and method shared during onboarding).</li>
      <li>Help onboard new members and maintain house systems.</li>
      <li>Guests (over 2 nights/week) must be approved.</li>
      <li>Responsibility includes upkeep of private and common areas.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2 id="worktraders">Additional Guidelines for Work Traders</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Expected to contribute the agreed number of hours per week in exchange for housing and in some cases food.</li>
      <li>Tasks may include cleaning, organizing, gardening, repairs, or special projects.</li>
      <li>Log your hours and communicate with your point person.</li>
      <li>Be reliable—communicate early if you can’t meet a deadline or shift.</li>
      <li>Respect household systems and participate in communal life.</li>
    </ul>
  </section>

  <section>
  <h2 id="conflict">Conflict Resolution</h2>
  <p>At New Congress, we aim to handle conflicts with empathy, respect, and open communication. If tension arises, tenants are encouraged to reflect first, then talk directly using "I" statements. If needed, housemates can help mediate or the matter can be brought to a house meeting. If expectations remain unmet, the house manager may step in to help find a resolution. We believe conflict, handled well, can strengthen our community.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>Power Dynamics & Shared Accountability</h2>
  <p>We recognize that having either the house owner or a designated house manager living on-site can introduce unique power dynamics. While this person may carry certain responsibilities, all tenants are encouraged to communicate openly and honestly—regardless of perceived authority. Everyone deserves to feel safe voicing concerns or giving feedback.</p>
  <p>As the owner, I have put over 1,000 hours of work into improving this house and continue to make enhancements nearly every day. I ask for patience and understanding when a space is temporarily messy due to a project in progress. Help is always welcome but never expected—and any support you do offer directly improves the home you live in.</p>
  <p>The house manager (which may be the owner) is committed to shared accountability and being receptive to respectful input. Tenants are encouraged to bring up concerns directly or request a mediator if helpful. Creating a healthy community means addressing issues together, not avoiding them.</p>
  <p>If you ever feel uncomfortable sharing feedback directly, you are welcome to do so via a trusted housemate or at a house meeting. We all play a role in shaping a fair and caring home.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2 id="final">Final Notes</h2>
    <p>By living here, you agree to uphold these community agreements. If you cannot meet these expectations, your month-to-month lease may not be renewed or in extreme cases be evicted before the lease is up.</p>
    <p>We’re excited to have you here. Let’s build something beautiful together!</p>
